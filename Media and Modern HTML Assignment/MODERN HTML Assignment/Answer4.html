        <div>
        <p>When building a website, choose a content management system (CMS) that supports web accessibility. Be sure that page <br>layouts, themes, widgets, plugins, and other aspects are compatible with web accessibility standards. </p></div>
        <li><h3> Structure and organize with headers</h3></li>
        <p>Headers are a great resource that, when used correctly, structure and organize content on a webpage. This allows all users to easily navigate your web pages, and even improve your SEO score making it easier for you to generate more traffic to your site.</p>
        <li><h3>Design forms for web accessibility</h3></li>
        <p>When designing online forms, it is important to properly label text fields with a descriptive title so people who rely on screen readers can properly complete the forms. Using label tags or an ARIA property will increase the accessibility of your web forms.
